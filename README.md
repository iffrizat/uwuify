# Uwuify
A small yet very malicious addon which adds uwu-talk to Garry's Mod. This is a must have for any server.
It adds 2 chat commands available to anyone:

**/uwu \<text\>**  
**/painuwu \<text\>**

Second one is what I call *pain* mode, it makes inputed text almost incomprehensible.  

*Start your year with something annoying, start it with installing uwuify!*  
**I am genuinely sorry for making this**
